    //
    //   * bare __try inside them: 36 first-chance AVs per cold open, and ModEngine3's host
    //     symbolized every one through dbghelp on the faulting thread - that IS the 2-4 s
    //     cold-open freeze ([stallcap] caught the map thread in me3_mod_host -> dbghelp).
    //   * every read routed through safemem: no AVs, but 6k-20k VirtualQuery calls per
    //     second (a refusal is never cached, by design) - factory pulses went from 6.5 us
    //     to 14 ms and reopens starved again.
    //
    // So: ONE validated probe of the node's own header, then the cheap SEH readers for the
    // walk itself - and a memo of the dead verdict, because the burst keeps asking about
    // the SAME dead pointer. A live node costs a cache hit (a few compares); a dead one
    // costs one VirtualQuery for the whole burst, and raises nothing.
    //
    // The memo is per-thread (these all run on the map thread) and EXPIRES: the allocator

    // ROOT CAUSE, established 2026-07-28 by reading and then poking the LIVE process:
    // `CS::CSFeManImp+0x78` is the HUD's own visibility mode - 3 = HUD on in gameplay, 1 = hidden
    // under a menu, 0 = what is left after our pushed screen closes. In the stuck state the engine
    // genuinely believes the HUD is off (mode 0, the 31 per-widget flags cleared, menu ids 7 and 26
    // demoted to registered-only); writing 3 back brought the HUD up instantly AND STUCK, which also
    // proves the mode is edge-driven rather than recomputed per frame. The engine reaches 3 again only
    // through its own 0 -> 1 -> 3 transition, which is why opening and closing any native menu fixes it.
    //
    // So the fix is symmetric cleanup, not a policy: capture the mode before we push and put that
    // exact value back once every screen of ours is gone. Two guards keep it honest - we only write
    // when the mode is still 0 (so a legitimate "menu on top" state is never overridden), and the

            // into this array - it has been excluded.

            // +0x9B..+0x9E:01->00`), so we did the same for exactly the bytes that were zero before us.
            // It did not bring the HUD back AND it made things worse: pressing ESC right after closing our
            // menu hung the game and crashed it. These entries are live state the menu machinery reads and
            // re-registers, so writing them from our thread races it - no matter which bytes are "right".
            // Conclusion: the HUD must be restored by making the GAME do it (call whatever the menu

    // ── Second host: 02_042_PC_GraphicSetting, the screen with REAL widgets ──────────
    // The key-binding form gives us an unlimited scrolling LIST, but its rows are two text

    // its page clip carries 15 row slots plus a ScrollBarV, and its rows ARE the engine's own
    // Slider / ComboBox / Button / TextInput widgets.
    //
    // Opening it is the same trick as the key-binding form, with two differences found by
    // decompiling both openers side by side:
    //   * FUN_1408079E0(out, owner, flag) builds an OptionSettingDialog job through the
    //     generic builder FUN_140808630 (movie block {8, 1, L"02_042_PC_GraphicSetting"},
    //     factory FUN_140807B10), where the key-binding form builds a MenuWindow job through
    //     FUN_1407ACB00. `owner` is the SAME host + 0x50 (read off the game's own call site
    //     at 0x14094FB02).
    //   * its tail is FUN_1407418D0 = a DLRefPtr assign, so `out` already holds an owned
    //     reference - the two fd40 conversions the other opener needs are not wanted here.
    // The game itself puts this screen in the SEQUENCE slot (it replaces the settings page);
    // over the live map we want it drawn on top, so it goes in the child slot instead.
    //
    // Its rows come from populate FUN_14095A5D0, and the page it populates is built by the
    // very same page factory (FUN_14095EB90) our settings tab already borrows - with clip
    // index 0xD = "GraphicOption" instead of 3 = "CameraSetting", which is exactly why that
    // one caps out at 12 rows with no scrollbar and this one does not.
    // The F6 graphics-screen host's own state (its populate hook type and pointer, plus the armed /
    // populated / host trio) stood here. The host was removed on 2026-07-28 once it was measured in
    // game - its list caps at sixteen rows and does not scroll - so nothing assigned or read any of
    // it. See docs/research_f6_graphics_host_retired.md.
    // (A build_our_rows() forward declaration stood here for the F11 settings tab's page populate.
    //  Both it and its definition went with that prototype.)



    // The populate only runs while the page is built, so disarm as soon as the screen is up -
    // and clear the host once the holder empties, so a second press can open it again.

    // ── the byte that decides who owns the input ─────────────────────────────────────
    // Both screen openers call the same core FUN_1407ACB00(out, owner, desc, factory) and differ
    // only in the DESCRIPTOR they hand it:
    //     F11's settings (input works):  { u32 8, u8 2, L"02_040_OptionSetting" }
    //     our form       (input dead):   { u32 8, u8 1, L"02_160_KeyConfiguration" }
    // and that byte is not a movie version - FUN_1408087E0 sets it to 1 only for the trial movie.
    // It is written by a single instruction with an immediate:
    //     0x140807967  MOV byte ptr [RSP+0x34], 0x1     -> immediate at RVA 0x80796B
    // so the experiment is one byte, flipped around our own call and put straight back. The same
    // trick the CommandList work already used on a rip-relative operand.
    // Kept as an OFFSET INTO the anchored function, not as an absolute RVA: the byte lives
    // 0x7B into keyconfig_form_build, and that anchor is the thing that gets re-found on a

    // docs/research_native_menu_screens.md.
    //
    // What ships instead is open_screen() below: one native screen per page, hosted on the
    // key-binding movie. It needs none of this.

    // job's scene/movie/factory/dialog fields so a Path-B settings job could be reproduced on the

    // so o_jobstep stayed null and the detour that dereferenced it was unreachable. That is not the
    // usual AOB-miss degradation; there was no scan at all.

    // opttop_ctor_detour stood here. Besides consuming g_our_f11_open (see the note above) it
    // logged the dialog's tab count under debug_logging; with the flag permanently 0 that log was
    // the only thing it did, on a hook installed for every settings-menu open in the game.

    // functions that had already been deleted. Its startup cost was real, though - setup() kept

        // can sit correctly in the logical list, satisfy every check we have, and still never be
